GTD App Specifications: Core Design Principles
1. Zero Leaks Policy
Requirements:
System must visibly track all captured items at all times
Display alerts/notifications for unprocessed inbox items
Flag uncategorized or undecided tasks prominently
No item can exist in the system without user awareness
Dashboard must show count of unprocessed items across all capture points
2. Minimal Friction UX
Requirements:
Maximum 3 clicks/taps for any core action (capture, complete, defer)
Auto-fill/smart suggestions for:
Project assignment based on context
Due dates based on patterns
Tags/contexts from previous similar items
Anticipate user choices using ML/history
Remove all non-essential UI elements
Fast-access quick capture from any screen (hotkey, widget, always-visible input)
3. Feature Validation Framework
Acceptance criteria for all features:
30-day test: Feature still discussed/relevant after 30 days
60-day test: Significant user adoption maintained
90-day test: Consistent ongoing usage demonstrated
Default-off for experimental features (opt-in via preferences)
Quarterly feature audit to remove unused functionality
4. Value-First Design
Requirements:
Every UI element must serve reproducible workflow value
No decorative or "nice-to-have" features in core app
Eliminate notifications/alerts that don't drive action
Remove features that create work rather than eliminate it
Zero cognitive burden: decisions only when necessary
Intentional design: every element has clear purpose visible to user
5. GTD Methodology Adherence
Core workflow requirements:
Strict implementation of GTD's 5 phases:
Capture (frictionless inbox)
Clarify (forced decision workflow)
Organize (projects/contexts/next actions)
Reflect (weekly review support)
Engage (context-based action lists)
Quality gates:
Internal team must use feature consistently for 30+ days before release
Feature must align with David Allen's GTD methodology
6-month sustainability test: "Will power users still use this?"
6. Trust & Attraction Balance
Requirements:
UI must feel inviting, not intimidating
Avoid creating psychological resistance through:
Overwhelming options
Punitive notifications
Guilt-inducing metrics
Focus user attention on actions, not the tool itself
Reward positive behaviors (completion, reviews) subtly
Success Metric
The Core Test: Does the app make users feel like the system works for them, or that they're working for the system?
