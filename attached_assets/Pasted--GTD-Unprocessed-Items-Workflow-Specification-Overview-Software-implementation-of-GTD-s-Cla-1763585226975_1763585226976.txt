# GTD Unprocessed Items Workflow Specification

## Overview
Software implementation of GTD's "Clarify" phase for processing inbox items into actionable outcomes.

---

## 1. Inbox Display

### Requirements
- **Inbox View**: Single consolidated list showing all unprocessed items
- **Item Count Badge**: Always-visible count of unprocessed items
- **Sort Order**: FIFO (First In, First Out) by default
- **One-at-a-time Processing**: Display single item in focus mode (optional setting)
- **No Escaping**: Cannot navigate away without processing or explicitly deferring

### Visual Indicators
- Unprocessed item count on main navigation
- Age indicator (items >48 hours highlighted)
- Source tag (email, voice note, quick capture, etc.)

## 2. Processing Decision Tree

### UI Flow: Sequential Forced-Choice Interface

**Question 1: "Is it actionable?"**
```
[YES] → Continue to Question 2
[NO] → Branch to Non-Actionable Path
```

---

### Path A: Non-Actionable Items

**Question 2A: "What is it?"**
```
[TRASH] → Delete permanently
[REFERENCE] → Move to Reference system
  ↳ Prompt: Category/Tag (optional)
  ↳ Action: Archive with metadata
[SOMEDAY/MAYBE] → Move to Someday/Maybe list
  ↳ Prompt: Add note (optional)
  ↳ Action: Store with review flag
```

**Processing Result**: Item removed from inbox, routed to appropriate system

---

### Path B: Actionable Items

**Question 2B: "What's the next action?"**

**Required Field**: Text input for specific, physical, visible next action
- **Validation**: Starts with verb (suggested: call, email, write, review, buy, etc.)
- **Helper Text**: "What's the very next physical thing you need to do?"
- **Examples Shown**: "Call John re: budget" NOT "Budget discussion"

**Question 3: "Will it take less than 2 minutes?"**
```
[YES - DO IT NOW] → 
  ↳ Provide "Mark as Done" button
  ↳ Timer starts (optional)
  ↳ Complete → Remove from inbox
  
[NO] → Continue to Question 4
```

**Question 4: "Are you the right person to do this?"**
```
[NO - DELEGATE] →
  ↳ Required: Assign to person
  ↳ Required: Set follow-up date
  ↳ Action: Move to "Waiting For" list
  ↳ Optional: Add to calendar
  
[YES] → Continue to Question 5
```

**Question 5: "Is this part of a bigger outcome?"**
```
[YES - PROJECT] →
  ↳ Required: Project name
  ↳ Optional: Project goal/outcome description
  ↳ Action: Create project, add this as first next action
  ↳ Prompt: "Capture other known actions?" (optional multi-add)
  
[NO - SINGLE ACTION] →
  ↳ Continue to Organize step
```

---

## 3. Organize Step (for Single Actions & Project Actions)

### Required Fields
**Context/Location** (Where can this be done?)
- Dropdown/tags: @Computer, @Phone, @Office, @Home, @Errands, @Anywhere, [Custom]
- Multi-select allowed

**Priority/Energy** (Optional but recommended)
- High/Medium/Low OR
- Energy required: High focus/Medium/Low energy

### Optional Fields
**Due Date**
- Date picker
- Default: None (GTD principle: most actions don't have hard deadlines)
- Flag if this is a true deadline vs. target date

**Time Required**
- Estimate: 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr+
- Used for filtering by available time

**Calendar Scheduling**
- Option to add to calendar if specific date/time needed
- Distinguish between "Do on date" vs. "Reminder on date"

**Tags**
- Additional custom tags beyond context
- Examples: client names, categories, themes

## 4. Processing Completion

### After Each Item Processed
```
✓ Item removed from inbox
✓ Routed to appropriate list:
  - Next Actions (by context)
  - Projects
  - Waiting For
  - Someday/Maybe
  - Reference
  - Trash
  
→ Immediately show next unprocessed item
→ Update inbox count
→ Optional: Show progress ("3 of 47 processed")
```

### Batch Processing Mode (Optional)
- "Process Inbox" dedicated mode
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid processing
- Undo last classification (one level)
- "Defer" button to skip item temporarily (flags for end of session)

---

## 5. Defer/Skip Handling

### "I'll Decide Later" Option
- **Button**: "Skip for Now"
- **Action**: Move to end of inbox queue
- **Flag**: Mark as "deferred" with count
- **Warning**: If item skipped 3+ times, show alert:
  - "This item has been deferred 3 times. Is it really actionable?"
  - Force decision: Delete, Someday/Maybe, or Process Now

---

## 6. Smart Suggestions (Optional Enhancement)

### AI/ML Assisted Processing
Based on historical patterns, suggest:
- Likely context (90% of your "call" actions = @Phone)
- Likely project association
- Similar past actions
- Typical time estimates for user

**UI Requirement**: Suggestions never auto-fill, only offer one-click acceptance

---

## 7. Processing Session Management

### Session Features
- **Start Processing Button**: Launches focused inbox processing mode
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar
- **Time Tracking**: Optional session timer
- **Interruption Handling**: Save state if user navigates away
- **Completion Celebration**: Inbox Zero confirmation
  - Simple, non-intrusive message: "Inbox processed ✓"
  - Option to proceed to Weekly Review if all items processed

---

## 8. Edge Cases

### Empty Required Fields
- Cannot advance without answering required questions
- Cannot save incomplete processing
- Clear error messages: "Next action required" not "Invalid input"

### Lost Context
- "Need more information" option → Creates action "Get clarity on [item]"
- Original item moved to Someday/Maybe with note

### Multiple Actions Discovered
- During project creation, allow rapid addition of multiple next actions
- Quick-add interface without leaving processing flow

---

## 9. Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab through decision tree
- Number keys for common choices (1=Actionable, 2=Not Actionable)
- Enter to confirm
- Esc to defer

### Mobile Considerations
- Swipe gestures for quick decisions
- Voice input for next action description
- Large touch targets for decision buttons

---

## 10. Data Validation Rules

### Next Action Validation
- Minimum 3 characters
- Must contain at least one verb (soft warning if not)
- Cannot contain only generic words ("stuff", "thing", "misc")

### Project Names
- Minimum 3 characters
- Unique names recommended (warning if duplicate)

---

## Success Metrics

- **Time to Process Item**: Average <30 seconds per item
- **Inbox Zero Achievement Rate**: % of users reaching empty inbox weekly
- **Defer Rate**: Items skipped <10% of total processed
- **Abandonment Rate**: Users starting but not completing processing <15%
